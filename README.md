#### Gameplay

##### Version 1.0

How the game should run:

1. Ask the user for a language, either Portuguese or English;
2. Ask the user for the username for both player;
3. Ask the player 1 for their symbol (X or O);
4. Show the Game Board and allow the player to play;
5. Once a player connect's 4 the game should end, with the player that connected being the winner.

##### Version 1.1

##### Note: The PvP gamemode is still the same as the one in the v.1.0, and only the PvAI will be discussed.

1. Ask the user for a language, either Portuguese or English;
2. Ask which gamemode the user wants to play, either Player vs Player or Player vs AI;
3. Ask the user for the username for both player;
4. Ask the player 1 for their symbol (X or O);
5. Show the Game Board and allow the player to play;
6. The player cannot win against the AI, as the AI will calculate if the player is almost connecting 4 and will block so that doesn't happen.

Have fun!
